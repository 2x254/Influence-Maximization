We collected data about Facebook pages (November 2017). These datasets represent blue verified Facebook page networks of different categories.
 Nodes represent the pages and edges are mutual likes among them. We reindexed the nodes in order to achieve a certain level of anonimity. 
The csv files contain the edges -- nodes are indexed from 0. We included 8 different distinct types of pages.
 These are listed below. For each dataset we listed the number of nodes an edges.
